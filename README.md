This is ENIGMA, my first proprietary Python project.


# WHAT YOU NEED TO RUN:

Python 3.10 or later

Python is available for Windows, Linux/UNIX and macOS, and can be downloaded at: https://www.python.org/downloads/



# TO RUN:

Simply run "enigma.py" and READ THE PROMPTS.

There's a playable tutorial before the match. It's skippable if you already know how to play.


# DESCRIPTION
The idea came about as I was studying arrays and thought a 2-dimensional array/matrix looked like a board and that could be used to make a game.

I haven't studied game design, so the actual gameplay might be wonky, but it was a nice way for me to study... idk, everything so far. Classes, functions, arrays, modules... I might list all "competences" of the project here in the future.

The most important information is that PLAYS WORK ON ENTIRE ROWS/COLUMNS. Just keep that in mind and the game (should) explain everything else.

Have fun!

Please save and send me the log if anything breaks.
